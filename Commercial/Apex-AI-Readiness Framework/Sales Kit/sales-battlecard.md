# Apex AI™ Readiness Framework

## Sales Battlecard



# 1. The Elevator Positioning

**One-Liner**

Apex AI™ helps organisations move from uncontrolled AI experimentation to governed, measurable, and commercially optimised AI operations.

**Stronger Commercial Version**

We assess your AI risk exposure, quantify productivity opportunity, and deliver a board-ready roadmap that turns AI from unmanaged risk into measurable return.



# 2. Ideal Target Profile

## Primary Buyers

* CEO
* CFO
* COO
* CIO
* Managing Partner
* Board / Audit & Risk Committee

## Ideal Organisation Characteristics

* 20–500 staff
* Microsoft 365 environment
* Early Copilot adoption or ChatGPT usage
* Concern about governance or compliance
* Curious about ROI but cannot quantify it
* Board asking questions about AI

## Trigger Events

* Copilot purchase underway
* Data privacy concern raised
* Audit committee asking about AI controls
* Budget cycle planning
* Competitor using AI publicly



# 3. Core Problems We Solve

### Problem 1 – Shadow AI Risk

Staff are already using AI tools privately. There is no visibility or control.

### Problem 2 – Governance Gap

No formal AI policy. No risk register. No executive ownership.

### Problem 3 – No ROI Clarity

AI is “interesting” but nobody can show financial return.

### Problem 4 – Cost Exposure

Licensing and API consumption can scale unpredictably.



# 4. Discovery Questions That Open the Deal

Use these early.

* Who currently owns AI governance in your organisation?
* Is AI included in your enterprise risk framework?
* Do you know which staff are using AI tools today?
* Can you quantify productivity gain from AI usage?
* How are AI costs forecasted and monitored?
* Has the board formally reviewed AI risk?

If they hesitate or answer vaguely, you have an opening.



# 5. The Value Narrative

Move the conversation through this structure:

1. AI is already present
2. Uncontrolled AI increases risk
3. Structured governance reduces exposure
4. Measured productivity increases margin
5. Apex AI™ provides clarity and roadmap

Do not sell the workshop. Sell the outcome.



# 6. What They Actually Buy

They are not buying a report.

They are buying:

* Risk visibility
* Executive clarity
* Board confidence
* Budget justification
* A structured path forward

Position it as strategic insurance plus growth enablement.



# 7. Deliverables to Emphasise

When closing:

* Maturity Index Score (0–100)
* Risk Heatmap
* Financial ROI Model
* Governance Gap Analysis
* 90-Day Stabilisation Plan
* 12-Month AI Roadmap

Boards respond to structure.



# 8. Commercial Framing

## Price Anchoring

Small Business: $5k
Mid-Market: $10k–$15k
Enterprise: $20k+

Frame it like this:

“Compared to uncontrolled AI risk exposure or even a minor compliance issue, this is minimal.”

Never apologise for the price. It is a governance instrument.



# 9. Objection Handling

### “We’re already using Copilot.”

Response:
Copilot deployment is not governance. This framework ensures it is secure, optimised and financially controlled.



### “We don’t want to overcomplicate AI.”

Response:
This reduces complexity. It creates clarity so AI can scale safely.



### “We don’t have time.”

Response:
That is exactly why you need structure. Uncontrolled AI consumes more time through rework and risk exposure.



### “We’ll wait and see.”

Response:
AI adoption is already happening internally. Waiting means unmanaged risk accumulates quietly.



# 10. Competitive Positioning

Against Generic AI Consultants:
They talk strategy theory.
We quantify risk and ROI.

Against Internal IT:
They manage tools.
We align AI to governance and board oversight.

Against Big Four:
They are expensive and abstract.
We deliver practical execution and managed oversight.



# 11. Upsell Pathway

The assessment is the front door.

Natural follow-ons:

* Apex AI™ Governance Retainer
* AI Monitoring & Reporting Service
* Copilot Optimisation Program
* Custom AI Integration Projects
* Quarterly AI Performance Reviews

This is how it becomes recurring revenue.



# 12. Red Flags During Sales

If you hear:

* “We’re just experimenting.”
* “Staff can use it responsibly.”
* “It’s just ChatGPT.”

It means they are at Stage 1 or 2.
Risk is high. That is your entry point.



# 13. The Close

Use this:

“AI is already inside your organisation. The only question is whether it is governed and measured, or unmanaged and exposed. Apex AI™ gives you control and a clear path forward.”

Pause.

Let them respond.
